# Recipe-Search-Engine
This repository contains a Python-based application developed using IntelliJ that allows users to search for recipes based on an ingredient. The application uses the Edamam Recipe API to retrieve and display recipe suggestions for the given ingredient. 

The core functionality of the application is a function that sends a request to the Edamam API using the user-inputted ingredient as a search query, and returns recipes from the API. 

Additionally, the application offers extended functionality by saving the search results to a file and cross-referencing each ingredient against the Edamam Nutrition Analysis API. 

This project served as a practical introduction to Python programming and API utilization.
